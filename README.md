# Machine Learning using Azure

This project tries to analyze the data about the start-ups in the US, and based on their journey, tries to predict the success (or failure) of the new start-ups.
The projecg used Machine learning tools (Auto-ML in particular) in the Azure, and tries to build the most efficient model.

The dataset 'Investment.csv' was accessed from Kaggle.
'automl_dataset.parquet' is the same dataset in parquet format that we used for Azure.

Run_TwoClass.docx file explains the steps taken to preprocess data and build the model.
